This projet is an simple application allowing to execute processus on remote host.

This is compound of 2 parts:
- The remote processor "rproc" which can receive execution orders
- The remote controller "rcontrl" where user can define/start/stop command on remote processor.

Main functions are:
- Read standard and error output from the controller
- Save/load the processor lists and commands
- Order commands to perform sequential start
- Add pause in sequential start.

Have fun ...
